AI Street Interview Creation: A Documentation of the WorkflowThis repository documents the detailed, iterative process of creating a short, AI-generated "deep fake" or "AI street interview" video using a large language model (LLM). The focus is on the workflow and the importance of precise, iterative prompting to achieve a desired creative outcome.This project is a continuation of previous research, including the descriptive statistics and sports analysis work documented at the following repository:Prior Research: Task 05: Descriptive StatsProject MethodologyThe project was executed through a three-phase workflow centered on prompt engineering and qualitative analysis.Initial Prompt Formulation: A comprehensive prompt was crafted to establish the scene, characters, tone, and script. This served as the baseline for the first video artifact.Qualitative Analysis & Iterative Refinement: The initial video was reviewed to identify shortcomings, particularly in the "deep fake" elements like voice quality. The prompt was then refined based on this feedback.Final Generation & Analysis: The refined prompt was submitted to produce an improved video. The success of this attempt was used to draw conclusions about the most effective methods for AI-driven creative production.Phase 1: Initial GenerationThe first prompt aimed to create a comedic contrast between a cheerful Pikachu interviewer and a serious gorilla professor.Initial Prompt:A short, funny 8-second interview video. Scene: On top of a giant pyramid, with desert and sky in the background. Two characters sit with microphones. Character 1: Pikachu interviewer wearing a tiny Detective outfit, cheerful, says "Pika" sometimes. Character 2: A gorilla in a professor’s blazer and glasses, serious and analytical. Tone: Comedic contrast. Pikachu asks silly questions, Gorilla gives a real stat. Script: [Pikachu]: "Pika pika? Who’s the fastest in baseball?" [Gorilla]: "The fastest MLB players sprint just over 30 miles per hour." [Pikachu]: "Pika! Faster than me?" [Gorilla]: "Definitely. Numbers don’t lie."
Outcome: The video successfully rendered the scene and characters. However, the voices were a key failure point; the Pikachu voice was generic, and the gorilla's voice lacked the intended gravitas for comedic effect.Phase 2: Iterative RefinementTo address the voice quality, the prompt was refined to be more specific.Refined Prompt Modifications:Pikachu's voice: "squeaky like the real Pikachu voice."Gorilla's voice: "with the voice of Shaq."This deliberate use of a celebrity voice as a reference point was crucial for guiding the AI's synthesis capabilities and moving the task beyond generic voice generation.Final Generation & ConclusionThe final video, generated with the refined prompt, successfully incorporated the specific voice characteristics. The contrast between the high-pitched Pikachu and the deep, commanding "Shaq" voice of the gorilla created a much more impactful comedic dynamic.This project demonstrates that successful AI content generation is a collaborative, iterative process. The researcher's role is to act as a prompt engineer, providing detailed and specific feedback to guide the AI toward a desired creative outcome.
